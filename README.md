Characteristic	Multivariate
Number of attributes:	17
Number of instances:	2111

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+

Data Set Information:
This dataset includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical conditions. 
The data contains numerical data and continuous data, so it can be used for analysis based on algorithms of classification, prediction, segmentation, and association.

VISUALIZATIONS:

The aim of this project is to depict relationships between various attributes. A few relationships that can be considered are as follows:

1.	Age, Height and Weight ( BMI ) vs Obesity
2.	Eating and exercise routines vs Obesity
3.	Consumption of Alcohol & Smoking vs Obesity
4.	Age, family history vs Obesity  
5.	Gender, Age vs Transportation
6.	Time using technology, exercise, and meal consumption vs Obesity 
7.	Consumption of food between meals, Gender vs Obesity.
8.	Consumption of water and Alcohol vs Obesity
9.	Consumption of Water Daily in terms of Alcohol and smoke vs Age-Obesity
10.	Transportation used by different age, weight, gender vs Obesity
